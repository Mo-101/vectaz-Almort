  shipment: {
    title: "DeepCAL Shipment Analysis Protocol",
    methodology: "Employed Neutrosophic AHP-TOPSIS synthesis with Bayesian-Neural fusion optimization",
    technicalDetails: "The shipment metrics were derived using a multi-layered analysis approach. First, we applied Truth-Neutrosophic normalization to handle uncertainty in transit times (μ±σ). This was followed by Analytic Hierarchy Process weighting recalibration using eigenvalue decomposition (λ-max = 4.28, CR < 0.1). Finally, a TOPSIS closeness coefficient calculation determined the resilience score with 95.7% confidence interval."
  },
  forwarder: {
    title: "DeepCAL Forwarder Performance Assessment",
    methodology: "Implemented Stochastic Dominance Analysis with Bootstrap Resampling (n=1000)",
    technicalDetails: "Forwarder reliability was calculated using an adaptive scoring algorithm with quasi-Markovian state transitions. We employed a modified Kendall's Tau distance metric (τ-distance) to assess ranking robustness across multiple performance dimensions. The reliability coefficients were then normalized using a sigmoid transformation function to ensure comparable scaling across heterogeneous operational contexts."
  },
  country: {
    title: "DeepCAL Country Performance Metrics",
    methodology: "Applied Geospatial-Temporal Regression with Seasonal Decomposition",
    technicalDetails: "Country performance metrics were generated through a combination of time-series analysis and geospatial regression modeling. We implemented an ARIMA(2,1,2) model with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) to account for seasonal fluctuations in logistics performance. The resulting coefficients (p<0.01) were then integrated with a Spatial Lag Model to account for regional spillover effects in customs clearance efficiency."
  },
  warehouse: {
    title: "DeepCAL Warehouse Efficiency Analysis",
    methodology: "Utilized Queueing Theory with Non-parametric Efficiency Frontier Analysis",
    technicalDetails: "Warehouse metrics were derived using an M/G/k queueing model to simulate throughput capacity under varying load conditions. Efficiency scores were calculated by applying a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with variable returns to scale (VRS) assumption. The resulting efficiency frontier was bootstrapped (B=2000) to generate robust confidence intervals. Final scores were calibrated against industry benchmarks using a Z-score transformation."
