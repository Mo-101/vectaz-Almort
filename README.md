## 🧠 Project Overview

**DeepCAL** (Decision Engine for Emergency Logistics) is an intelligent multi-criteria freight forwarder evaluator. It leverages **Neutrosophic AHP-TOPSIS algorithms** to rank forwarders based on uncertainty-aware factors like:

- 💸 **Cost**
- 📦 **Reliability**
- ⚡ **Responsiveness**

This repository hosts the application logic, decision engine, and full-stack integration powered by:

- ⚙️ TypeScript + React  
- 🧪 Python Neutrosophic Models  
- 🔗 Supabase (data, auth, storage)  
- 🌀 Tailwind CSS & shadcn-ui
