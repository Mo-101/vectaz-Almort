Your overall logistics performance shows a DeepScoreâ„¢ of ${overallPerformanceScore.toFixed(1)}/10. Key metrics include: average transit time of ${avgTransitTime.toFixed(1)} days, on-time delivery rate of ${(onTimeDeliveryRate * 100).toFixed(1)}%, and average shipping cost of $${avgShippingCost.toFixed(2)}/kg. Your highest performing carrier is ${topForwarder?.name}, and your most reliable corridor is to ${mostReliableCorridor?.country}. What specific aspect of your logistics would you like insights on?`;
